# BoseHubbardGutzwiller
Gutzwiller ansatz for Bose-Hubbard model, with simulated-annealing optimization

# What is this

# How to use it
This code is tested on python 2.7, and the following libraries are required:
+ [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
+ [cython](http://cython.org/) 


# Notes
If necessary, the code can be optimized further.
A simple change would be to use the gsl random-number generator (see <a href="http://pyinsci.blogspot.it/2010/12/efficcient-mcmc-in-python.html">here</a>), which is not implemented in this version to avoid an additional dependency.
